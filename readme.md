Optical Music Recognition (aka OMR)
===

This was made as a project for the [Wolfram Summer School]() (WSS). It's essentially an OCR, but for sheet music.

For explanations and code, please refer to the [notebook under "Final Project"](Final Project/Final Submission/OCR_For_Sheet_Music.nb).

As it happens, it also contains miscelaneous stuff from the Summer School (templates, computational essay, etc.).
